# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

I wanted to create a simple way to plan out my work day using a daily planner to create a schedule. This will help manage time effectively. I wanted to display the current date and time at the top of the page to improve the user expereince. A typical work day is 8 hours (9am-5pm) so I created 8 time blocks. I made the time blocks dynamically color coded based on the time of day to indicate wether the event is in the past, present, or future. When a user clicks on a time block they can enter an event and that event will be saved and displayed when the page is refreshed using localStorage. During this project I learned and practiced BootStrap and jQuery and learned they are helpful tools to dynamically altering and creating html elements and css classes. I used dayjs to work with current date and time.
